IMPORTANT: Vercel & Static Assets

1. Create a folder named "public" at the root of your project (same level as index.html).
2. Inside "public", create a folder named "assets".
3. Upload your photo "main_photo.png" into "public/assets/".

The final path should be:
/public/assets/main_photo.png

The code has been updated to reference the image as "/assets/main_photo.png", which Vercel serves from the public folder.
